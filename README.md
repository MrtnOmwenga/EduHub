# EduHub

### Introduction

This project aims to make learning more accessible to people without a reliable internet connection by organizing learning objectives into short modules downloadable in pdf format. I worked on this project myself taking on the role of a full-stack developer. This project is aimed at people in rural and other poorly developed areas.
